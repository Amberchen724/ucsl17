    "Welcome to __U__rban __C__omputing __S__kills __L__ab. This course is a pre-requisite for your Masters program in Applied Urban Science and Informatics, which immediately begs the question: what is Urban Science? It is actually hard to define Urban Science especially given how ubiquitous the term has become. In my mind, Urban Science is an emerging domain of research at the intersection of interdisciplinary sciences that seeks to exploit the large-scale data, from a variety of sources, to understand and address urban challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, I would encourage you to think of Urban informatics not as a new domain of knowledge to learn, but a new set of skills that you can apply within your current area of expertise. By the end of this bootcamp, I hope to:\n",
    "- Get you familiar with Python programming language (that will be used throughout your Masters course)\n",
    "- Introduce you to scientific tools for performing data analysis\n",
    "- Exemplify efficient way of storing and visualizing the data\n",
    "- Give you a demo hands-on experience for developing solutions in real-world"

Thus, this Lab in no way aims to be a comprehensive introduction to Python or programming language in general.

We will then familiarize ourselves with the simple-but-important terminologies like kernel, jupyter notebook etc. and understang how combination of these tools makes the perfect environment for data scientists. Finally, we will be introduced to the basic Python syntax, concept of whitespaces, using comments and general [`PEP8`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) styling guidelines which we will follow throughout our Lab (and something you should follow, always.)."

The time that you will be spending in learning the core concepts of Python will be valuable for performing data(agnostic) analysis. In this section we will learn some basic concepts on single and multi-dimensional `arrays` and understand the differnce between Python's built in types and Numpy arrays. We will perform numerical operations on Numpy arrays and take a look at Numpy's universal functions. Since we will be dealing with large datasets, we will also cover the concepts of indexing and slicing numpy arrays and some fancy (and fast) ways of getting a chunk of data from a huge dataset."

Matplotlib is a large project and can seem daunting at first. However, by learning the components, it should begin to feel much smaller and more approachable. We will begin our quest to visualize complex data by starting with plotting simple lines and curves and understanding every element that goes into creating an output figure. We will then look at another interesting companion module `seaborn` that will help beautify the output figures without much tinkering. Slowly progressing we will learn about some of the differnt types of plots and look at specific examples where each type is suitable. Throughout this section we will be reminded of selecting proper type of plot, color maps/ palletes, ticks. In the end we will look at Matplotlib's style sheets that will help you get publication quality figures."

I know it can be mouthful but wait till we look into the implementation of Pandas dataframes. Instead of a traditional way of introducing the functions and showing the implemetation example, this time we will get our hands dirty with a real-world dataset and try to answer the questions as _data scientists_, unraveling the mystery of Pandas!"
