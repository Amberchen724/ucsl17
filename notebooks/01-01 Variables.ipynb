    "As the name implies, a variable is something that can change. A variable is just a way of referring to a memory location used by a python program. Based on the datatype of the variable, the python interpreter allocates the memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. This makes python a **dynamically-typed** language.\n",

    "> - If you are familiar with other programming languages like C, C++ or Java it might be tempting to consider variable as just a container to store data. However in Python, you can at best, think of variables as pointers. This is why you can *dynamically* change the type of data that a variable is pointing at."

    "One of the main differences between Python and strongly types languages like C++ or Java is the way it deals with the data types. In languages like C++ or Java, every variable must have a unique data type i.e if a variable is of type string it cannot store integers or floats. Moreover every variable has to be declared before it can be used, thus binding it to the data type that can be stored in it. Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable. This means that a variable that was used to store a string can now be used to store an integer. Try it out. Do something like this:"
